Python Collections (Arrays)

List
--

List are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

* Ordered (have a defined order)
* Changeable (we can change, add, remove an item after list was created)
* Allow duplicates values (lists are indexed, so we can have the same value)

Terminal tip:
> help([].remove)

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.


* Ordered* (from python version 3.7)
* Changeable/mutable
* Unique/ no duplicates allowed

Similar to list, but are using keys instead.
A key may have a list of elements as value.
